This is a deep stacked rbm used to create music from sentiments of images. 4 models are created:
	1.Happy
	2.Sad
	3.Fear	
	4.Suspense

It also contains a REST API in Flask for sending and receiving data, expecially the MIDI files


The deeprbm model is greatly inspired from the blog post at http://danshiebler.com/2016-08-10-musical-tensorflow-part-one-the-rbm/




p1.py and rest.py are very important
